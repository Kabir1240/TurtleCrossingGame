# TurtleCrossingGame
Created turtle crossing game in python using turtle graphics.  
After the turtle reaches the end of the screen, it teleports to its original position. The level increases and the cars will go faster.
Use the 'W' key to move forward. You cannot move back, left or right.  
Once you die, click the screen to close it.  
  
Update:  
  -> Added an executable file. Just download the zip file, extract and run the exe.
